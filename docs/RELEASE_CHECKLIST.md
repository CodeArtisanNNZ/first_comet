- [x] Chromium interactions and overflow checks at 320, 360, 390, 520, 768, 1024, 1280, and 1440 pixels; light/dark and mobile screenshots inspected
- [ ] Execute Java and PHP examples in real runtimes (binaries unavailable here)
- [ ] Native Windows PowerShell runner smoke test

The public deployment serves static files from `public/` and does not run the private API. The legacy npm commands cannot run because this repository has no `apps/web` or frontend `package.json`; the test scripts fall back to static course checks. Private backend items and historical statuses below retain their original scope.

- [x] Default-browser launch with duplicate-server detection
- [x] Project gallery and full-width workspace navigation
- [x] Protected file editing, reviewed save and reviewed Quick Push
- [x] Open connected repository in VS Code without shell interpolation
- [x] Guided Windows prerequisite installation when `winget` is available
- [ ] Smoke-test browser launch, folder picker, Git Credential Manager and VS Code opening on Windows
- [ ] Produce a signed standalone Windows installer for non-developer distribution
